			I'm actually not convinced that unit testing this class is actually a good idea.
				I mean, unit tests is meant to verify public functionality, right? To make sure that changes you make don't change any behavior that other pieces of code elsewhere expect to work one way.
				But everything in this class is private, and all of its functionality is either in event delegates, or already being unit tested by individual class tests.
				IDK. Maybe I'm missing something here. For now I'll just test the fruit movement, because that's what's on the card.
